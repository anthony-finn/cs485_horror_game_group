# Forest of the Damned

An SMS-based horror game.

# Running

The game is meant primarily to be run as a server, though

```sh
sudo ./run_server.py
```

(The server does not require root, but does require the ability to bind to port 80.)

Mainly for development purposes, it is possible to simulate the SMS interface through your local terminal, by

```sh
sudo ./run_server.py
```
