## The map of the game

Included here is a rough draft of the map layout of the game. The player would start at the center of the map and would spawn at the center. The map would be a 5x5 grid which would contain crystals located in each of the columns. The points of interest would be places where crystals would automaticaly spawn whereas the remaining ones are located randomly at the map.

# Additional notes

+ The map may be too large with a good amount of coordinates being empty. We could reduce this to a 4x4 and have 2 crystals spawn in a random column.
+ The hellhound hostile (mentioned in the dialogue.txt) could be something that could spawn in the same location as the player or spawn elsewhere and roam throughout the map.
+ The player cannot go out of bounds. Though an easter egg of them either them entering an endless void or instant death could be something to consider.
