You've reached [Forest of the Damned], an SMS-based game! Text BEGIN to this number to start a new game. Text HELP for a complete list of commands. (Note: Commands are case-sensitive.)

> BEGIN

Welcome to [Forest of the Damned]! Throughout the game, you will see actions surrounded with |pipes|. Text us this phrase (without the pipes) to perform that action (case-insensitive). Type |ok| to continue.

To view a list of commands, text HELP (in all caps).

*Possible responses*:
-   ok: [GOTO Exposition]
-   pipes (#000)

> pipes (#000)

We only surrounded the word 'pipes' in pipes to tell you their name and meaning. Nonetheless, your usage is correct according to the rule we just taught you. We respect your outside-the-box thinking, so consider this an Easter Egg.

The game's exposition and plot takes influence from the Slenderman video game released in 2012 as well as the demonic theme taken from HP Lovecraft's "Call of Cthulu".

[GOTO Exposition]

# Exposition

You are a prisoner being sent to do forced labor mining crystals essential for the fascist empire. You bowed your head low as the prison guards drove you to the location, remembering how even petty crimes can face severe punishments such as this one. The pguards pushed you out of the prison truck with only a pickaxe as you navigate this foggy forest. It has been said that prisoners sent here have never returned. As you travel further into this void, you realize that something... inhuman is happening here.
