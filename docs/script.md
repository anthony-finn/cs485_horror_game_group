TODO: Title for game

# Pre-Game

> (Player has no save file, types anything something besides "BEGIN")

You've reached [title], an SMS-based game! Text BEGIN to this number to start a new game. Text HELP for a complete list of commands. (Note: Commands are case-sensitive.)

> BEGIN

Welcome to [title]! Throughout the game, you will see actions surrounded with |pipes|. Text us this phrase (without the pipes) to perform that action (case-insensitive). Type |ok| to continue.

To view a list of commands, text HELP (in all caps).

*Possible responses*:
-   ok: [GOTO Exposition]
-   pipes (#000)

> pipes (#000)

We only surrounded the word 'pipes' in pipes to tell you their name and meaning. Nonetheless, your use of the action 'pipes' is correct according to the rule we just taught you, and we respect your outside-the-box thinking.

We humbly present to you this Easter egg! Feel free to brag about it to anyone who will listen.

[GOTO Exposition]
